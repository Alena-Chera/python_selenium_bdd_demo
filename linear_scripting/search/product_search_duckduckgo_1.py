Web test cases for DuckDuckGo search functionality
DuckDuckGo is a search engine that doesn’t track user data.
Users can enter search phrases and get links to matching websites.

Test procedure:
1.	Navigate to the DuckDuckGo home page
2.	Enter the search phrase
3.	Verify that:
  a. Results appear on the results page
  b. The search phrase appears in the search bar
  c. At least one search result contains the search phrase
It’s basic, but it covers typical searching behavior end-to-end.


Feature: Search using DuckDuckGo
Scenario: Basic DuckuckGo Search
