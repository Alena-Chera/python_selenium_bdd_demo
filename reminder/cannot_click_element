Sometimes I got the issue:

'The element that I wanted to perform a click on
     is obscured by another element.
 I would have already verified the state of the element before the click.
 Things I can consider doing is
     perform a wait and may be maximize the window/scroll to the element which ever is applicable.
  But the element was not clickable'


 This execute_script.command helped me:

 element = driver.find_element_by_xpath("//button[@role='button']")
 driver.execute_script("arguments[0].click();", element)
