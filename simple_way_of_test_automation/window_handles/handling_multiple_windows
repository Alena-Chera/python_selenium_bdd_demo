Handling multiple windows in Python Selenium



Python Selenium provides option to handle multiple windows using ‘window_handles’.
Python Selenium WebDriver assigns an id to each window as soon as the WebDriver object is instantiated or new window is opened using a WebDriver object.
This unique id is known as window handles.

Also note that WebDriver object always controls only one window at a time in the current session.
For example, opening a link in new window does not transfer control of WebDriver to new window.
WebDriver will be still controlling the old window and any operations that we perform using Selenium script will be forwarded to this old window.

We can use this unique id to differentiate a window and switch control among multiple windows.

     Python provides two in-built objects:

          1. window_handles

          Returns the handles of all windows within the current session.

          Syntax: driver.window_handles

          2. current_window_handle

          Returns the handle of the current window.

          Syntax: driver.current_window_handle
