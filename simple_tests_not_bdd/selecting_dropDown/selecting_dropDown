                           Selecting A DropDown


Since a dropdown has many options, so it is important that we select something separately.
Selenium Python API provides the Select class, which allows us to select the element of our choice.

First, we need import the "Select":
from selenium.webdriver.support.select import Select

Note : The Select class only works with tags which have select tags.

Then, we can select
using the Index of Dropdown:
                   if the dropdown has an “index” attribute, then we can use that index to select a particular option.
                   We need to be careful while using this way, because it is not un-common to have the index start at 0.

                   We can use the "select_by_index()" method to select an option using the index attribute.

using the Value of Dropdown:
                   if the html mark-up defines an option tag, then we can use the value matching the argument.

                   We can use the "select_by_value()" method to select an option.

using the Text of Dropdown:
                   we have to match the text which is displayed in the drop down.

                   We can use the "select_by_visible_text()" method to select an option.
